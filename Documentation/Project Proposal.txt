My project is a library management system. This system will allow users to view books within the library. Additionally, this system will allow librarians to check out / in books, manage user accounts, gather information on who has specified checked out books, and more. Users can expect this to be a text based program. Here is a brief outline of some capabilities of users and librarians:


(Inputs and Outputs)
User:
Search Books
Sort books


Librarian(Extension of user):
Add books
Remove books
Check out books to users
Check in books
Create user profiles
Edit user profiles
Get information on a book such as who has it checked out



ADTS that will be used include array lists to manage the book catalogue and users, as well as abstractions for users, admins, and books
I used Visual Studio Code with the Java programming language as my software, I additionally used Microsoft Visio for creating UML diagrams
